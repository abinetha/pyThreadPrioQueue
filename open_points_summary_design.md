### Any Open Points:
- Implementing logging: Currently, error handling is done using print statements. Enhancing this with a logging framework like Python's logging module would provide better control and flexibility over logging.
- Enhancing error handling: While the current error handling is sufficient for basic scenarios, further refinement and error propagation mechanisms can be implemented to handle more complex error scenarios.

### Summary of Good Design/Coding Concepts Used:
- **Encapsulation**: Classes such as PriorityMessageQueue, ThreadPool, and MessagePasser encapsulate their respective functionalities, providing a clear interface for interaction while hiding internal implementation details.
- **Modularity**: The project is structured into separate modules and classes, promoting modularity and ease of maintenance. Each component (e.g., PriorityMessageQueue, ThreadPool) handles a specific responsibility, contributing to a well-organized codebase.
- **Abstraction**: The use of abstractions like queues, locks, and threads abstract away complex underlying operations, making the code more readable and understandable.
- **Thread Safety**: Synchronization mechanisms such as locks are employed to ensure thread safety in multithreaded environments, preventing race conditions and ensuring data integrity.
- **Error Handling**: The code includes basic error handling mechanisms to handle exceptions that may arise during execution, ensuring robustness and resilience.
- **Documentation**: Comments and docstrings are used throughout the code to explain functionality, parameters, and usage, enhancing readability and maintainability.
